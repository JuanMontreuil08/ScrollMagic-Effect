# ScrollMagic-Effect
Discover this great effect to improve your web development

Index.html: here i write the basic code to create the page, titles and section. Also i linked the app.js and style.css files, and the CDN JS effects to create the animation.
Style.css: Here i established the colors of the page, the position, the font-family
app.js: i established the const controller, select the scene 1-2, the duration of the video, created the animation of the text by modifiging the opacity and create a e function to improve the scroll effect by dividing the duration / 1000 in order to fix well with the page.
